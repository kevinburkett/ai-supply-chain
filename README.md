This repository contains a Go backend and a simple Python FastAPI service.

## Running the FastAPI app

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the server with uvicorn:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This launches the API at `http://localhost:8000`.
